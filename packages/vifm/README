Vifm is an ncurses-based file manager with vi-like keybindings. If you use vi,
vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to
learn a new set of commands.

The configuration for vifm sits in ~/.vifm/vifmrc.

Vim users:
A vifm.vim plugin is included in /usr/doc/vifm-$VERSION. Read the INSTALL file
there for usage information.
