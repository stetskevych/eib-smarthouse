This XFree/X.Org driver provides support for touchscreen input devices.
The driver is actually a evdev driver which supports events for moving in
absolute coordinates, relative coordinates and events for mouse buttons.

This driver primarily supports TouchKit touchscreens (like the one found in
Samsung Q1, GIRA/Proface panels and other computers), but may potentially work
with any device that is not supported by stock Xorg drivers in Slackware.

The bundled calibration tool is currently (for a few years already) broken,
but manual calibration should be pretty straightforward, just pick the right
MinX, MinY, MaxX, and MaxY driver parameters in xorg.conf.

You can find your touch screen model by looking at /proc/bus/input/devices.
This file also lists the event interfaces for the corresponding device, like
"Handlers=event1" or similar.

To mitigate the problem of event listener numbers being constantly changed
by udev when new input hardware is added to the system, this driver creates
a special event listener at /dev/input/evtouch_event for convenient use in your
configuration.
