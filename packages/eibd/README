The BCU SDK is a free development environment for BCU1 and BCU2 devices for the
KNX home automation bus (formerly known as the European Installation Bus, EIB).

The eibd daemon is the key component of the BCU SDK. It provides an
interface to the EIB/KNX bus. It supports the following backends:
- FT1.2/BCU2
- PEI16/BCU1 (using the BCU1 kernel driver)
- TPUART
- EIBnet/IP Routing and Tunneling
- KNX over USB
Eibd provides APIs for various programming languages and a number of
example programs written in C.

A sample startup script for Slackware is provided along with the SlackBuild.
