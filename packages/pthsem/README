pthsem is an extended version of the GNU Pth, a user mode
multi threading library, with added support for semaphores.
This package can be installed in parallel with a normal pth,
which is included in Slackware.

This version includes a patch by the developer to make pthsem use the
monotonic clock and be able to react to date and time changes more adequately.
